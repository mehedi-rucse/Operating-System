When we execute processes by opening terminals in the following order:
        ProcessA at first, then ProcessB, then ProcessC and at last ProcessD.



1. ProcessA creates 3 pipes named 1stPipe,2ndPipe,3rdPipe.
2. Then in ProcessB, As we write into 1stPipe.It waits for any reader to read and doesn't terminate.
3. In ProcessC, As we write to 2ndPipe first then read from 1stPipe. ProcessC also waits for any reader to read first. As a result, It never reads from 1stPipe. 
4. ProcessD does the same as ProcessC, As here also we write to 3rdPipe first then read from 2ndPipe. It keeps waiting for any reader to read first . As a result, It also never reads from 2ndPipe. 

Hence ProcessB,ProcessC and ProcessD all three process remains stucked in the write process and never reads.
