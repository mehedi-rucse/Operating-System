	File Name: ThreadCreation.c
	Purpose: To understand how multi-threading works.
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	How to Run: 
	A. At one terminal, type
		$ gcc ThreadCreation.c -o ThreadCreation -pthread
		$ ./ThreadCreation

		** We will see a flow of three messages at different order
		5 + 3 = 8
		5 - 3 = 2
		5 - 3 = 2
		5 - 3 = 2
		I am the unstoppable main thread.
		5 + 3 = 8

   B. At another terminal, type
		$ pstree
		
		** We will be able to see a process named 'threadCreation' with two
		threads inside curly brackets.
		├─gnome-terminal-─┬─bash───threadCreation───2*[{threadCreation}]

		$ pstree -p
		├─gnome-terminal-(2026)─┬─bash(2035)───threadCreation(14682)─┬─{threadCreation}(14683)
                             		                                  └─{threadCreation}(14684)
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Notes:	
	A.	If we forget to write -pthread, we would get an error message
		similar to the following error message.

		$ gcc threadCreation.c -o threadCreation 
		/tmp/cceFx1jH.o: In function `main':
		threadCreation.c:(.text+0x78): undefined reference to `pthread_create'
		threadCreation.c:(.text+0xb4): undefined reference to `pthread_create'
		collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

	B. If we do not use infinite loop, we would not be able to
		trace either process or newly created threads by pstree command.

	C. It is better to open the terminal in full screen mode to see
		the whole tree structure.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
	Necessary Library Function:
	A. pthread_create()

		A.1. Task: 
			Create two new threads which will execute separately from
			the main thread.

		A.2. Synopsis:
	 		1. Original form:
				int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start_routine) (void *),  void *arg);

      	2. At the beginning, we can use a simpler form:
		int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, NULL, void *(*start_routine) (void *), NULL);
		** 	After creating a thread successfully, our process will
			get thread's ID at the first parameter.

			The code for each thread needs to be put in a function.
			Third Parameter is the name of that function.

		A.3. Return Value:
			0 on success and an error number on failure.

		A.4. Header File:
			#include <pthread.h>
